So in this problem basic stack operations have been used. Input file acts as the postfix operation where we need to perform basic arithmetic operations through it and get stack.top()
 as the final operation. In the stack numerals are put by traversals, when any arithmetic operation falls on side... two operators are carried away further along with the
 operation and previous numerals are popped out by replacing with desired operated value and the process is repeated till we get the desired single output.# -6Companies30days
